Even if you can debate how many of Lightning's smile are a hundred percent genuine, he's got a knack for afflicting the mood with his presence. Tiny yet mighty, they can not only insist you are safe while staring down the enemy but back it up with the ferocity of claws and moves some cats would be surprised to see come out of ditz Lightning. Strategy in the throws of combat make him a nasty opponent even for cats twice his size - ever aware if he's struck too hard by some massive warrior's paw that the ground would be unforgiving. 

 Cliche as it definitely sounds, his intense determination only doubles when their clan's safety as a whole or loved ones are brought into the fray. Without an escalated situation that sways his mind otherwise, Lightning doesn't hide how he'd sooner throw claws than see even an antagonistic clanmate reach harm. In a positive light, Dayclanners would claim willpower and adrenaline make him formidable towards predator or cats who press their luck even when time doesn't afford them much thought.

 Mastering the art of underestimation is not all swipes and yowls though! Lightningspark has cultivated a past filled with debatable decisions into an illusion of mental absence - let those who desire judgment have their cake, it makes them all that much easier to eavesdrop upon. 
 Victimized by Dayclan gossip once or twice.. that doesn't stop this young tom from being an expert word slinger himself. He'll participate in any good game of telephone unless it hits dangerous tiers of misinformation (provided Lightning's aware) and just as with family, those clan relations can be rocky but that's simply life in his opinion. Sometimes you're getting whispered about and sometimes you're whispering - what else would they do with their time? Coo over bones like Duskclan or work their paws to the bone Nightclan style? Pass. 

 Lightning is rather devoted, sometimes toeing fault, yet plenty of cats would compliment him as a brave soul. Fearless yet mindful, eccentric but scrupulous! 

 This Dayclan lad can only hope these strengths are becoming louder than those already perceived flaws nowadays..
